# Implementation of ChatGPT-3.5-turbo API
# Goal: Get a recipe in natural language by giving prompt of list of ingredients
#Â Question whether we need ChatGPT-4 (potentially implement payment method for token payments, i.e. payments are collected
by token-metric, each API request has given amount of units (tokens) which are used to calculate payment to openai)

Code:
import openai

openai.api_key = "Insert API-Key here"


response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
            model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
            messages=
                    [
                    {"role": "system", "content": 'You are a cook giving a recipe with any given ingredients.'},
                    {"role": "user", "content": 'Give a recipe using all ingredients in a given list of food items'}
                    ]
        )
            
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
