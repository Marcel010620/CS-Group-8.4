# Implementation of ChatGPT-3.5-turbo API
# Goal: Get a recipe in natural language by giving prompt of list of ingredients
# Question whether we need ChatGPT-4 (potentially implement payment method for token payments, i.e. payments are collected
# by token-metric, each API request has given amount of units (tokens) which are used to calculate payment to openai)
